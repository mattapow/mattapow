Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Macaulay :wave:

I'm a post-doc researcher at the University of Technology Sydney looking at Bayesian methods for the phylogenetic anaylsis of viruses.
I'm currently visiting the Lanfear Lab @ ANU.

## Phylogenetics :herb::herb:

I'm investigating scalable Bayesian methods for real-time phylogenetics. The overall aim is to develop novel techniques that allow Bayesian phylogenetics to scale for viral outbreaks. I'm working on applying a variety of Bayesian techniques (MCMC, HMC, MCMCMC, SMC, and variational inference) to phylogenetics. I'm developing embedding methods for these problems by embedding the tree model into hyperbolic space.

## Granular Physics :snowflake::snowflake:

I have also researched the rheology of granular flows. Inter-particle cohesion has a significant but understudied role in granular flows such as avalanches, powder flows, and landslides. I numerically investigated the grain-scale mechanisms behind their viscous and diffusive. This investigation informs continuous models of granular flows, providing a physical basis for these models.

## Data Centric Engineering :factory::factory:

I also have an interest in including data in online engineering applications. This includes optimsation, Bayesian inference and filtering. I worked on these ideas at the University of Sydney's Digital Sciences Initiative.

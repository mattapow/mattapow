Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Macaulay :wave:

I'm a post-doc researcher at University of Technology Sydney.

## Phylogenetics :herb::herb:

I currently investigate scalable Bayesian methods for real-time phylogenetics. The overall aim is to develop novel techniques that allow Bayesian phylogenetics to scale for viral outbreaks. Iâ€™m interested and looking to collaborate in Baysian Phylogenetics projects.


## Granular physics :snowflake::snowflake:

Throughout my PhD, I researched the rheology of cohesive granular flows. Inter-particle cohesion has a significant but understudied role in granular flows such as avalanches, powder flows, and landslides. I numerically investigate the grain-scale mechanisms behind their viscous and diffusive. This investigation informs continuous models of granular flows, providing a physical basis for these models.

Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Macaulay :wave:

I'm a post-doc researcher at the University of Sydney looking at Data-Centric Engineering.

## Phylogenetics :herb::herb:

I previousl investigated scalable Bayesian methods for real-time phylogenetics. The overall aim is to develop novel techniques that allow Bayesian phylogenetics to scale for viral outbreaks.


## Granular physics :snowflake::snowflake:

I have also researched the rheology of granular flows. Inter-particle cohesion has a significant but understudied role in granular flows such as avalanches, powder flows, and landslides. I numerically investigated the grain-scale mechanisms behind their viscous and diffusive. This investigation informs continuous models of granular flows, providing a physical basis for these models.

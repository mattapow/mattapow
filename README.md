Hi, Iâ€™m Matt Macaulay :wave:

I've done resreach in a few scientific numerical modelling fields. Here's my:

## Tsunamis :ocean: :ocean:
I'm currently researching tsunami and their potential impact on Australia with [matt-mac-ga](https://github.com/matt-mac-ga). At Geoscience Australia I'm developing tsunmami indunation models to form probabilistic models of the threat of tsunamis to the Australian coastline. Working with emergency management teams to identify areas for evacuation in the event of a tsunami warning.

## Phylogenetics :herb::herb:

As a post-doc reseacher at the University of Technology Sydney, I investigated new Bayesian methods for the phylogenetic anaylsis of viruses. The goal is to develop scalable Bayesian methods for real-time phylogenetics by developing novel techniques that allow Bayesian phylogenetics to scale for viral outbreaks. I'm working on applying a variety of Bayesian techniques (MCMC, HMC, MCMCMC, SMC, and variational inference) to phylogenetics. I'm developing embedding methods for these problems by embedding the tree model into hyperbolic space. I had a long term visit with the Lanfear/Bui Lab @ ANU, creators of [iqtree](https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree2).

## Granular Physics :snowflake::snowflake:

At the university of Sydney, I researched the rheology of granular flows. Inter-particle cohesion has a significant but understudied role in granular flows such as avalanches, powder flows, and landslides. I numerically investigated the grain-scale mechanisms behind their viscous and diffusive properties. This investigation informs continuous models of granular flows, providing a physical basis for these models and allows continunuus scale approximations of their flow field.

## Data Centric Engineering :factory::factory:

I also have an interest in including data in online engineering applications. This includes optimsation, Bayesian inference and filtering. I worked on these ideas at the University of Sydney's Digital Sciences Initiative.
